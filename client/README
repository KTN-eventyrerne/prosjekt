This is the client side.
It currently works with a testServer.py
Using local ip and port 1558.
When server side is finished, testServer.py and test.py can be removed.

Confirmed working:
-login
-message passing
-lisen/receive message
-send message
-type message, just type in window. No "type a message"-message, 
because it would lead to a messy screen....
-logout

IMPORTANT:
-What about displaying username?
-What about chatt session logg? See important 1 in appclient.py. 
(and assignment description)


TO RUN:
1. run testServer.py
2. run test.py, see appclient.py
